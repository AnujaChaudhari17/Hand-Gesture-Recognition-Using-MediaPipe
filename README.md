# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-MediaPipe
To enable accurate and customizable recognition of hand gestures for applications in human-computer interaction and assistive technologies.


Model Development:

Training TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) models for real-time recognition tasks.
Using key point and fingertip coordinate histories for robust gesture classification.
Real-Time Integration:

Implementing OpenCV for webcam integration.
Adding adjustable detection and tracking confidence parameters for enhanced usability.
Script Design:

Crafting modular scripts for data collection, FPS measurement, and gesture classification.
Enabling seamless model training and testing workflows.
This project aims to create an efficient system for gesture recognition with potential applications in human-computer interaction, assistive technologies, and AR/VR systems.
